A minimal, modular, Arabic-first starter plugin scaffold (Dashboard / Settings / Records / Help, REST stubs, i18n, scoped assets)
plus an example dashboard widget that fetches tweets from two GET webhooks and renders responsive Arabic tweet cards.

No external icon libs. Scoped CSS/JS. RTL-first. Local font (Readex Pro).
